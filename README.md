# All Circassian Dictionaries Collection

This repository contains a collection of Circassian dictionaries that have been gathered from various sources, processed, and organized in different formats for use on the [Learn Circassian](https://learncircassian.com) website.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `rawData`
This folder contains the original, untouched Circassian dictionaries as they were obtained.  
- Most of the data here is unstructured and unparsed.
- Some dictionaries were received in HTML format directly from their original sources.
- No modifications have been made to the content in this folder.

### 2. `organizedData`
This folder includes dictionaries that have been partially processed and modified into a more workable state.
- The data has been cleaned up and made more consistent, but it is **not** fully converted to JSON or ready for structured programmatic use.
- Unfortunately, HTML-based dictionaries could not be fully parsed and converted in this version.

### 3. `organizedDataInHTML`
This folder contains the finalized version of the dictionaries, fully converted into HTML format.
- These are the files currently used on the Learn Circassian website.
- Each file includes all necessary HTML layout and styling classes for seamless integration with the frontend.
